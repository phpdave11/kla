# Templates

You may find yourself running the same command over and over again, instead of doing that, just create a template!

Each [Environment](000_environments.md) has an optional `template_dir` you can specify which houses `toml` files specifying subcommands. If you have an environment with templates already you can run `kla run --help` for a full list of what they are and what they do. Kla interprets these files at runtime to build subcommands for `run` making them highly integrated with kla for a seamless experience (enough buzz words, let's make one)

Let's assume you have the following kla commands you run ALL THE TIME and you want to turn it into a template.

```bash
kla /api/v1/doc/233
kla DELETE /api/v1/doc/233 '{"force": true}'
```

Let's start with the basics; create a file in the environments `template_dir` named `doc.toml`

```
uri = "/api/v1/doc/{{ id }}"
help = "View a document"

[[arg]]
  name = "id"
  required = true
```

With this alone we can already look at the document with the following command:

```bash
kla run doc 233
```

but we need to delete as well. For that let's add a `--delete` flag that will change the method

```toml
uri = "/api/v1/doc/{{ id }}"
# OooOOooOO templating
method = "{% if delete %}DELETE{% else %}GET{% endif %}"
help = "View a document"

[[arg]]
  name = "id"
  required = true

[[arg]]
  # specifies the --long-flag, note the omitted `--`
  long = "delete"
  short = 'd'
  name = "delete"
  # we default to a string, but this is a bool
  type = "Bool"
  # when the flag is present we want the value to be true
  action = "set_true"
```

Many values within the template are... well, templated... hence the name. They use the context from `[[arg]]` to help define things like uri, method, body, etc. The templating engine is [Tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/). Now we can run the following

```bash
kla run doc 233
kla run doc 233 --delete
```

Next lets address the body

```toml
uri = "/api/v1/doc/{{ id }}"
method = "{% if delete %}DELETE{% else %}GET{% endif %}"
help = "View a document"
body = """
{"force": {{ force }} }
"""

[[arg]]
  name = "id"
  required = true

[[arg]]
  long = "delete"
  short = 'd'
  name = "delete"
  type = "Bool"
  action = "set_true"

[[arg]]
  long = "force"
  name = "force"
  type = "Bool"
  # notice the default is a string!
  default = "false"
  action = "set_true"
```

Whew looks like we are done!

```bash
kla run doc 233
kla run doc 233 --delete --force
```

Hold up though! Melisa from the docs department API department just let you know you can specify a `format` as a query param where you can select `json` or `yaml`. You remind Melisa that there is an HTTP header better suited for that, but she rolls her eyes at you; Typical Melisa! We could use templating in the uri, something like `uri = "/api/v1/doc/{{ id }}?format={{ format }}"` but Melisa has informed you they haven't landed on the final format yet so you want your template to utilize the APIs default value instead of hardcoding your own.


```toml
  ...

  default = "false"
  action = "set_true"

# The new stuff!
[[arg]]
  long = "format"
  name = "format"

[[query]]
  name = "format"
  value = "format"
  when = "{% if format %}yes{% endif %}"
```

Now when you supply a format to the command it will render as a query parameter.

```
kla run doc 233 --format yaml
```

The `when` operator will add the query parameter when it has a non empty value.. so `yes` could have also been `four score and blah blah blah`.

# Configuration

Alright, here is the full configuration available to you now that you are familiarized with things.

```toml
# The short description is used to define the short help, and will be displayed
# when you run `kla run --help`
short_description = "Example template, helping define how to make templates"

# It's often a good idea to link to any documentation on the endpoint you are
# hitting here
