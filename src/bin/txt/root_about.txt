Kla is a CLI tool that whos goal is to make it easy to interact with HTTP APIs. Instead of scowering the internet for the appropriate arguments to make a curl call, you can instead just pass a few arguments to the terminal and get things done. A Few examples!

Examples: 

Make a post to your ntfy server
> kla post /my_scope 'your cron job finished successfully'

Delete an elasticsearch index
> kla delete /logs-20251011

Run a template which lists authors
> kla --env poetry run authors

Make a request to a fully qualified endpoint, ignoring the current environment
> kla get http://example.com/ubuntu.iso -o /Downloads/ubuntu.iso

The root command within kla expects 1 to 3 arguments. It uses these arguments to construct an http request.

- A single argument will be a path `kla [path]`
- Two arguments are the method and path `kla [method] [path]`
- Three arguments are method, path and body `kla [method] [path] [body]`

The request utilizes the current \"environmnent\" which can be selected with `kla switch`. Environments are defined in your config file.

If you make a request often enough it's time to make a template. See `kla run --help` for more information.
